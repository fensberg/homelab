# Epoch 02 — Abstraction

- **Tier / path:** `modules/`
- **Branch:** `epoch/02-abstraction`
- **PR:** —
- **Status:** Not started

## Goal

Write the reusable pieces once. Turn the one-off resources proven in epoch 01
into parameterized modules that staging and production can both consume
without copy-paste.

## Scope

In scope (per `README.md`):

- `modules/infrastructure/` — OpenTofu modules with `main.tf` / `variables.tf`.
- `modules/applications/` — Kubernetes bases for Flux/Kustomize overlays.

Explicitly out of scope:

- Per-environment values and overlays — epoch 03. A module that knows it is
  "staging" is not a module.
- Changes to `management/` — epoch 01.

## Open questions to settle first

- Which epoch-01 resources genuinely want to be modules, versus staying
  single-use in `management/cluster`?
- Module versioning: relative path in-repo, or tagged and pinned?
- Does the self-hosted runner have what these modules need at apply time?
  `deploy-infrastructure.yml` path-filters on `modules/infrastructure/**`, so
  a change here triggers a real apply.
