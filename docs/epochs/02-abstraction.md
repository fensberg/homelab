# Epoch 02 — Abstraction

- **Tier / path:** `modules/`
- **Branch:** `epoch/02-abstraction`
- **PR:** —
- **Status:** Not started

## Goal

Write the reusable pieces once. Turn the one-off resources proven in epoch 01
into parameterized modules that staging and production can both consume
without copy-paste.

## Scope

In scope (per `README.md`):

- `modules/infrastructure/` — OpenTofu modules with `main.tf` / `variables.tf`.
- `modules/applications/` — Kubernetes bases for Flux/Kustomize overlays.

Explicitly out of scope:

- Per-environment values and overlays — epoch 03. A module that knows it is
  "staging" is not a module.
- Changes to `management/` — epoch 01.

## Known driver: multi-site deployment

The management root is currently hardcoded to one site. `base_cidr`,
`node_count` and the derived node addresses are locals in `variables.tf`, and
`organization.name` becomes the Talos cluster name. Deploying a second site
from the same code would advertise a colliding subnet onto the tailnet and
name its cluster identically.

Turning those into module inputs is the concrete reason this epoch exists.
The likely shape is one config file per site rather than one shared template,
so the subnet, cluster name and overlay-network credentials all vary together.

### The unit of addressing is the site, not the hypervisor

A subnet per hypervisor node is the wrong split. Nodes in one Proxmox cluster
must share a subnet, because a single Talos cluster spanning them needs its
members on one network. Give each *site* a /16 and subnet within it:

| Range | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `10.<site>.0.0/24` | hypervisor and infrastructure |
| `10.<site>.10.0/24` | Talos cluster nodes |
| `10.<site>.20.0/24` | load-balancer pool for workloads |
| `10.<site>.30.0/24`+ | per-tenant, if tenants get their own ranges |

Site 1 is `10.10.0.0/16`, site 2 `10.20.0.0/16`, and so on. Each site's subnet
router advertises its own /16, so there is one route per site and room to grow
inside it without touching the tailnet policy again.

Stay below `10.96.0.0`. Kubernetes defaults put services at `10.96.0.0/12` and
pods at `10.244.0.0/16`; those are cluster-internal and not routed over the
overlay network, but sharing the range invites confusion when debugging.

### One cluster per site, not one cluster across sites

A single Talos cluster with three nodes at each of two sites is a stretched
cluster, and it should be avoided. etcd raft is latency-sensitive - members
want single-digit millisecond round trips, and an overlay-network link between
sites will not deliver that. A partition between sites also leaves six members
with no tiebreaker.

The management-tier and workload-tier split this repo already describes is the
right shape: one cluster per site, all reconciled from one git repository by
Flux. Scale by adding clusters, not by stretching one.

## Open questions to settle first

- Which epoch-01 resources genuinely want to be modules, versus staying
  single-use in `management/cluster`?
- Module versioning: relative path in-repo, or tagged and pinned?
- Does the self-hosted runner have what these modules need at apply time?
  `deploy-infrastructure.yml` path-filters on `modules/infrastructure/**`, so
  a change here triggers a real apply.
